            <h2>Napolitin Spaghetti</h2>
            <h3>A mix of Eastern and Western Cuisine</h3>
            <p>A Japanese-style pasta dish made with a sauce that is tomato ketchup-based. Usually includes bell pepper, mushrooms, onions, sausage, and bacon. It is a fairly simple dish that is great for beginners. I honestly chose it bacuase I like to use ketchup as a sauce for leftover spaghetti. </p>
            <p>I got this recipe off of another website which I will include a link <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/ketchup-spaghetti-recipe/">here</a>. All credits to Namiko Chen of Just One Cookbook. There is way more information about the recipe and some indredients that were optional that I didn't include. I also removed and halved ingredients, but I will include what I adjusted in the notes.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>7 oz spaghetti (I used Angel Hair Pasta for mine)</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic</li>
                <li>1/4 onion</li>
                <li>2 Italian Sausages</li>
                <li>6 mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp milk</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Tbsp Ketchup</li>
                <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1-3 Tbsp reserved pasta water</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients you want to use.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta.</li>
                <li>While its cooking, mince the garlic clove and slice onion, sausages, bell pepper, and mushrooms.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, just until golden and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the onions to the pan and sauté for 2-3 minutes or until wilted.</li>
                <li>Add the sausages and sauté for 1 minute</li>
                <li>Add the mushrooms and sauté until everything is cooked.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>My Experience</h3>
            <p>The food turned out great for my first time though I went over estimated time. It took me closer to an hour because it took me a while to prep the ingredients. I was also scrambling during the cooking process. I had to measure the ingredients for the sauce because I didn't measure them before hand.</p>
            <p>I adjusted the ingredients depending on what I had at the time as well as to fit my family's preference. I removed green pepper and halved the onions. Not a big fan of vegetables and neither are my sisters. I also used some lactose milk because that is the only milk we had. Still tasted good so I don't think it affected the result. There was no cheese in the house so I wasn't able to add it, but I will be trying it next time. I did however add some mozerella cheese after the fact and it tasted pretty good. That might be more a preference though.</p>
            <p>All in all, it is a great recipe. It was fairly easy.</p>
